Undoubtedly, the presenters will be reacting to that at tonight’s Academy Awards; they’ll also be talking about an unusually interesting crop of Best Picture nominees, which you can read about below. Anthony Lane assesses Steven Spielberg’s “The Post,” and writes that Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me by Your Name” is “a true love story (and when did you last see one of those?)”; Richard Brody reviews Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” and Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird.” Helen Rosner explains why Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Phantom Thread” isn’t really about fashion—instead, it’s “one of the great food movies in recent memory.” Finally, Daniel Zalewski profiles Guillermo del Toro, the director of the monster love story “The Shape of Water,” and learns how he brings his affecting, phantasmagoric creatures to the screen.

None of them did. 共和党阿肯色州联邦参议员柯顿要求上述机构代表举起他们的手，询问他们是否推荐美国公民使用苹果竞争对手华为或手机制造商中兴的产品或服务。结果无人举手。 Chinese firms have come under greater scrutiny in the United States in recent years over fears they may be conduits for spying. In 2012, Congress released a report saying the two Chinese companies should be viewed “with suspicion.” The companies both strongly disputed the reports’ findings at the time, with Huawei calling them “baseless.” 近年来，中国企业在美国受到更严厉的审查，因为担心它们可能成为间谍活动的管道。2012年，美国国会公布一份报告指出，前述两家中国企业应以「疑虑态度」加以检视。这两家公司当时都强烈质疑该报告的发现，华为甚至称其为「无中生有」。 新闻辞典 stern：形容词，严肃的，严厉的，苛刻的。例句：He gave me a stern look.（他以严厉的目光注视我。） conduit：名词，管道，导管。例句：The computers were connected through a system of conduits.（这些电脑透过一套管道系统链接。） baseless：形容词，毫无根据，无基础的。例句：It’s a baseless rumor that the baseball player used steroids.（该名棒球员使用类固醇是毫无根据的谣言。）我目前使用kaldi分成两块: hmm-gmm和神经网络。学习kaldi的话，先从hmm-gmm入手比较好，像steps/train_delta.sh, steps/train_fmllr.sh, steps/decode.sh这些脚本都是基于hmm-gmm模型。kaldi官网上没有多少关于hmm-gmm的资料，没有hmm-gmm基础知识的初学者可能对于decision tree，alignment, lattice这些概念一头雾水。若要搞清楚这些概念，可以看语音识别另一开原工具htk的文档htk book，htk book是学习hmm-gmm很好的一部著作，将hmm-gmm从训练到解码的过程讲解的很透彻。只要知道决策树，训练/识别网络扩展，viterbi解码，EM算法，区分训练这几个概念的原理hmm-gmm也就理解透彻了。htk book对于这些都有讲解，部分内容如EM算法，区分训练需要看一些文献。htk book第二，八，十，十二，十三章需要重点看；在学习htkbook的过程中，可以结合着kaldi的脚本对照理解；比如steps/train_delta.sh中build-tree命令那部分的代码对应htk book第十章tree-based clustering, gmm-est命令那部分的代码对应htk book第八章的Parameter Re-Estimation Formulae;搞清楚hmm-gmm之后对语音识别就有了一个清晰的理解，接下来就可以上手神经网络。kaldi支持很多神经网路，如MLP, RNN, CNN, LSTM，如果对神经网路了解不多还是从MLP入手较好，MLP是神经网路中最基础的模型。神经网路kaldi有3个工具nnet1, nnet2, nnet3，初学者可以从nnet1开始。nnet1使用的是hmm-dnn架构，相关的知识可以查阅微软俞栋2009-2013期间发表的论文。nnet2的架构和nnet1同样是hmm-dnn架构，但是使用的是dan povey团队设计的NSGD算法，支持多线程并行训练，学习nnet2可以追dan povey从2012年之后的论文至于nnet3，chain model,以及其他的神经网路结构(rn,cnn,lstm)的学习，当完成我上面的说的学习内容后自然对语音识别有一个大体的认识，后面要做的就是看相关的文献。微软，dan povey，google, 多伦多大学来自这些地方的论文不断的追就行了。 最后总结，语音识别是对理论要求很高的方向，学习过程中一定要注重理论知识的学习，很多公式还是有必要自己去推导下才能有深刻的理解。 文献: HMM-GMM部分 : HTK Speech Recognition Toolkit http://lasa.epfl.ch/teaching/lectures/ML_Phd/Notes/GP-GMM.pdf 此文献详细讲解了hmm-gmm训练算法的推导过程 http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/em-paper.pdf 此文献详细讲解了EM算法的基本原理 Discriminative Training for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition (PDF Download Available) 此文献详细讲解了区分训练的基本原理 神经网络部分: Dan Povey kaldi作者Dan Povey的个人主页，学习nnet2, nnet3, chain model看Povey的论文会很有帮助； dnn部分: Conversational speech transcription using context-dependent deep neural networks Context-dependent pre-trained deep neural networks for large-vocabulary speech recognition 微软俞栋和多伦多大学合作，逐层训练rbm，将训练得到的rbm连接起来作为dnn训练的初始模型. 并将dnn与hmm结合用于语音识别，kaldi的nnet1工具使用的就是上述2篇论文的架构; lstm部分: Long short-term memory recurrent neural network architectures for large scale acoustic modeling Long short-term memory based recurrent neural network architectures for large vocabulary speech recognition kaldi例程中使用的lstm架构便出自于google的这两篇论文 Training deep bidirectional LSTM acoustic model for LVCSR by a context-sensitive-chunk BPTT approach kaldi中lstm的训练算法便出自微软的这篇论文 cnn部分: Advances in very deep convolutional neural networks for lvcsr Dense prediction on sequences with time-dilated convolutions for speech recognition kaldi中cnn的例程较少，而且其最新的cnn实现单元TimeHeightConvolutionComponent 与机器视觉那边的cnn实现有着很大的区别, 如果按照机器视觉中的cnn实现去做语音识别，那么训练的计算复杂度太高；kaldi最初的cnn实现单元ConvolutionComponent的设计思路和机器视觉cnn实现的思路是一致的，但是由于计算复杂度太高，现在已经打算废弃;上述两篇文章出自IBM，我在学习kaldi cnn的过程中发现kaldi TimeHeightConvolutionComponent设计的思路应该是出自这两篇论文，这种cnn架构学界称为dilated cnn，非常适合语音识别的模型训练，能够大幅度降低训练时间; 《语音识别实践》：微软研究院俞栋对HMM-DNN架构在语音识别中的相关理论讲解；内容主要是2009~2014期间学术界关于HMM-DNN架构的论文； 《模式识别》: 这本书第四章的非线性分类器作为神经网络的入门还是很合适的，理论讲解很详细","categories":[],"tags":[],"keywords":[]},{"title":"Under the Gun","slug":"gun","date":"2018-02-27T09:08:13.285Z","updated":"2018-02-27T09:08:13.241Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/02/27/gun/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/02/27/gun/","excerpt":"","text":"Since February 14th, when a nineteen-year-old gunman allegedly killed seventeen people and wounded many more at a high school in Parkland, Florida, The New Yorker has been covering the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting and its aftermath.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index followed suit, dropping just over five percent in its worst trading day since August 2015. 日本的日经指数在交易期间一度下跌幅度达到7%，最后以21,610点收盘，下跌将近5%。香港恒生指数也随后下跌，跌幅超过5%，是2015年8月以来的最大跌幅。 The benchmark indexes Australia and South Korea also suffered serious losses.In early Europe trading London’s FTSE 100 was down 3.5 percent at 7,081 points. 澳大利亚和韩国的主要股指也损失惨重。在欧洲，星期二上午伦敦FTSE100指数下跌3.5%，下跌到7,081点。 Asian markets were caught in the ripple effect of Monday’s 1,175-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, marking the biggest point decline in history. The S&amp;P (Standard and Poor’s) 500 also had a bad day, losing just over four percent to finish at 2,648 points. 星期一，美国道琼斯工业平均指数下跌1,175点，创下一天下跌点数最高的记录。华尔街的股指下跌影响了亚洲股市。标普500指数星期一也大幅度下跌，跌幅超过4%，以2,648点收盘。 The stock market has now lost about a trillion dollars in value since Friday, when the Dow lost 666 points. That drop followed a solid jobs report that showed the U.S. economy adding 200 thousand jobs and wages rising at the fastest pace in a decade. The tighter labor market and rising wages prompted investor fears of higher inflation and the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates faster and higher than they have in recent years. 自星期五美国道琼斯指数下跌666点以来，股市蒸发了大约1万亿美元的价值。在股市大幅度下跌之前，美国就业市场报告显示，美国经济新增20万就业，工资上升呈现10年来最大幅度的增长。劳工市场吃紧，工资增加，导致投资者担心出现高通货膨胀，美国联邦储备委员会将加速提高利率，加速程度超过过去几年。 ##Vocabulary Misery: 名词， 痛苦； 不幸； 穷困； 悲惨的境遇ripple: 动词， 使泛起涟漪； （把头发）弄成波浪形； 使作潺潺声；","categories":[],"tags":[],"keywords":[]},{"title":"Those in 20s, 30s are least happy among age groups in S.
