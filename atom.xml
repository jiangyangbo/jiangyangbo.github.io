    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since February 14th, when a nineteen-year-old gunman allegedly killed seventeen people and wounded many more at a high school in Parkland, Florida, The New Yorker has been covering the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting and its aftermath. Emily Witt learned how the survivors have begun the Never Again movement, spoke to students about their sorrow and anger, and travelled with them to Tallahassee; Charles Bethea met Florida gun owners and wrote about the Internet trolls who are exploiting the shooting for their own ends; and Evan Osnos responded to the extraordinary CNN town hall in which Marco Rubio—“ashen, unmanned”—faced the parents of victims.</p><p>This week, we’re bringing you some of our most insightful writing about guns in America. In “Four Truths About the Florida School Shooting,” Adam Gopnik reminds us of the fundamental facts that should be shaping our response to mass gun violence; in “What’s Really Standing in the Way of Gun Control,” Jeffrey Toobin explains why it’s lack of political will, not restrictive legal precedent, that’s preserving the status quo. In longer pieces, Jill Lepore explores the complex history of gun regulation in America, and Evan Osnos examines the economics of the gun business. Finally, Jelani Cobb and Margaret Talbot reflect on previous mass shootings—last year’s shooting at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas and the 2016 attack on the Pulse night club, in Orlando, respectively. Let’s hope that the Parkland shooting will be a turning point in this sad, enraging story.</p><p>—David Remnick</p>]]></content>
